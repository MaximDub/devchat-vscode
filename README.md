## What is DevChat?

DevChat is an open-source tool that helps you write prompts to generate code and documentation.
It is _not_ limited to performing predefined operations on short code snippets.
  
DevChat is the way developers interact and collaborate with AI.

:speech_balloon: Build the future with prompts, _not_ code.

## Why DevChat?

- To enable AI to write code, DevChat assists you in providing **the right context** for AI.
  
  Chat history, code, files, directory trees, `git diff --cached`, or the output of any command.

- To apply AI-generated code, DevChat streamlines your **actions to take**.

  View diffs, copy or insert, commit & sync, or export to documentation, wikis, and more.

- To guide AI in your work, define **your own workflows** with DevChat.
  
  Prompt templates, iterative calls to AI, and program operations.

- To suit your preferences, customize **your own experiences** with DevChat.
  
  Open-source, no waiting for opaque feature schedules. Access GPT-4 today and more models in the future.
  
## What is Prompt-Centric Software Development (PSSD)?

- The traditional code-centric paradigm is evolving.

- Write prompts to create code. Transform prompts into everything.

- It is DevPromptOps

## Quick Start

  - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
  - Open the Extensions view (⇧⌘X), search for DevChat, and install the extension:
  
 
  - Since DevChat is designed for developers, it requires a Git repository folder to store metadata. Therefore, open a Git project.
  - Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`.
  - Click on the DevChat icon in the status bar. If the API key setting is not configured, it will prompt you to enter it. Simply input the key.


  - We recommend dragging the DevChat logo from the left sidebar to the right sidebar to avoid overlapping with the Explorer.
